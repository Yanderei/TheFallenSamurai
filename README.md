GAME STORYLINE:
The main character, Kenji Inei, a homeless orphan child, was taken in by the Great Master Kusho.
He dedicated himself to the art of the blade and understanding spiritual tenets, quickly outpacing
his peers both in combat and study. Even so, he felt overshadowed by another—his master’s son,
Shen. Though Kenji's passion shone through in every technique he perfected, he lacked Shen’s
emotional balance.
In time, the idea of becoming stronger than everyone else became an all-consuming obsession for
Kenji. He was possessed by an unquenchable thirst for power and strength. The realization of his
darkness dawned on Master Kusho which led to the decision to halt Kenji's training and
have him devote himself to mediation instead.
Soon after, the Master trained Shen to become his successor. Kenji's heart bloomed with
resentment and he began to struggle in his studies and thoughts.
Out of frustration, he ventured deep into the forest where he came across an abandoned temple,
and there he discovered an ornate box. He remembered studying about this box in the Order of
the Shadows and knew it was forbidden to any but the masters of the order, but he still peered
inside.
Shadows enveloped Kenji's mind, feeding his bitterness with contempt for the weak, and hinting
at ancient, dark magic.
Returning to the Master's temple, he came face to face with Great Master Kusho and demanded to
resume his training to get stronger, but his request was met with refusal. After this attempt, he
secretly trained in the forest and realized his own abilities would never match his ambitions
without the box.
As he was on his way back to the abandoned temple, he was met by Master Kusho. He pleaded
with Kenji not to go forward to find the temple because the path is guarded by demons under the
Masters of the Order which were sent by Master Kusho. The elderly man laid his weapons at
Kenji's feet implored his former pupil to renounce the shadows in favor of a more balanced path.
Moments later, Kenji emerges onward into the forest to find the abandoned temple with his
freshly bloodied blade.
Inspired by: Zed's lore from League of Legends, Tai Lung's lore from Kung Fu Panda, and the
game, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

GAMEPLAY:
The player will control Kenji and use sword attacks to eliminate all demon guards (enemies) in his
path that come between him and the ornate box. In order to force his way through the path to
the abandoned temple, the player can move Kenji with the use of the arrow keys and the
spacebar for his sword attacks. The map will consist of various obstacles and the player must find
a way to navigate through the map to avoid or fight enemies in order to reach the abandoned
temple. The demon guards will engage in combat with Kenji once he reaches within a particular
proximity of them (still not 100% on if I will do proximity). The game will have 2 levels, where
Kenji must advance by defeating the first set of guards and navigating through the map to reach
the obelisk (landmark), which will take him to the second level with another set of guards that
do more damage and makes it harder to reach to the second obelisk. When the player reaches the
second obelisk, this will carry them to the abandoned temple where they will find the ornate box,
which is what Kenji is after.
GOAL: Eliminate all enemies and advance to get the ornate box.
